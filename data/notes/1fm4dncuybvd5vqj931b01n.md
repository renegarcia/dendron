# Load R script into session

To load the contents of an R script, you can use the `source()` function¹. This function reads the specified R script file and runs the code contained within it. For example, if you have an R script named `my_script.R` in your working directory, you can load its contents by running the following command in the R console: `source("my_script.R")`¹. This will execute all of the code contained within the `my_script.R` file¹.
